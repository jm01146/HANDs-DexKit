# HANDs-DexKit
Project with CISCOR at FAMU-FSU Engineering Center as a PhD project. Making a cheaper Hand interactive robot to teach kids about the possiblilites of robotics design


## Note from testing 9/23/25
This gantry system was bought as a kit you can build for a CNC router with a web interface once connected.
**YOU CAN NOT DO ANYTHING WITH THIS PRESET**. You must get the bluetooth version to interact with the device with this code.
Hopefully we can get a WiFi version to work but with all the things we want to connect to the GUI its going to be difficult.

The aim is simplicity and ready use.
